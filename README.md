  How to Recover Corrupted Firebird or InterBase Databases with IBSurgeon FirstAID 3.5 
Firebird and InterBase are popular open-source relational database management systems that offer high performance, scalability, and security. However, like any other database, they can be corrupted due to various reasons, such as hardware failures, power outages, network issues, or human errors. When this happens, the database becomes inaccessible and the data may be lost or damaged.
 
Fortunately, there is a tool that can help you recover your corrupted Firebird or InterBase databases: IBSurgeon FirstAID 3.5. This tool can automatically diagnose and repair corrupted databases, and recover corruptions that neither gbak nor gfix can fix. It supports Firebird versions from 1.0 to 4.0, and InterBase versions from 4.0 to 2020.

## What is Database Corruption and How FirstAID Repairs It?
 
Database corruption means that some links between internal structures of the database are broken. When the database engine sees a broken reference to a missing record or database page, it stops working with an error message like this:
 `Internal gds software consistency check ()` 
or, for recent Firebird versions:
 `Internal Firebird software consistency check ()` 
Such error messages are reported by gbak tool, by gfix (it writes them into firebird.log), and by end-user applications. The first part of this error is a common prefix for bugcheck (i.e., serious error), and in the parentheses, there are details of the error. Usually, such error prevents normal work with the database, and the recovery procedure should be executed.
 
If it was not possible to fix a corrupted Firebird or InterBase database with standard means (gfix.exe and gbak.exe), it is time for IBSurgeon FirstAID. IBSurgeon FirstAID is designed to work with the database directly, on a very low level – it allows bypassing erroneous places where the engine crashes and either fix broken links or export all user data to a new database.
 
## Two Options to Recover Firebird or InterBase Database with FirstAID
 
IBSurgeon FirstAID can perform two kinds of recovery operations: direct recovery and data extraction.
 
- **Direct recovery** is intended to fix the original corrupted database in place. This is a very fast and efficient method: after fixing the broken links, the database usually becomes readable, and it is possible to perform backup and restore.
- **Data extraction** is intended to export all user data from the corrupted database to a new one. This method is slower but more reliable: it reads metadata from the database and reads records bypassing the server. It also resolves dependencies such as foreign keys, triggers, and UDFs. The speed of data extraction is about 1 GB/hour.

## How to Use IBSurgeon FirstAID 3.5?
 
The steps to use IBSurgeon FirstAID 3.5 are as follows:

1. Download FirstAID - no registration required.
2. Open the corrupted database with FirstAID and double-click on the table name, then browse through the table's data pages.
3. If you decide to recover the data you see in FirstAID, purchase the license (you'll get your password in 15 minutes after completing the purchase).
4. Select the recovery option: direct recovery or data extraction.
5. Click on the "Recover" button and wait for the process to finish.
6. Check the log file for any errors or warnings.
7. Open the recovered database with your application or with any Firebird or InterBase tool.

## FAQs
 
In this section, we will answer some frequently asked questions about IBSurgeon FirstAID 3.5 and database corruption.
 
### What are the main causes of database corruption?
 
There are many possible causes of database corruption, but some of the most common ones are:

- **Hardware failures**: such as disk errors, bad sectors, power surges, or overheating.
- **Software bugs**: such as errors in the database engine, drivers, operating system, or antivirus software.
- **Network issues**: such as connection drops, packet losses, or network attacks.
- **Human errors**: such as accidental deletion, modification, or truncation of database files.
- **Malware infections**: such as viruses, ransomware, or trojans that can damage or encrypt database files.

### How can I prevent database corruption?
 
While it is impossible to completely eliminate the risk of database corruption, there are some best practices that can help you minimize it and protect your data:

- **Backup regularly**: make sure to backup your database files frequently and store them in a safe location. You can use gbak tool to create a backup file that can be restored later.
- **Verify your backups**: make sure to test your backup files periodically and ensure that they are valid and consistent. You can use gfix tool to check and validate your backup files.
- **Use reliable hardware**: make sure to use high-quality hardware components that are compatible with your database system. You can also use RAID or SSD to improve performance and reliability.
- **Update your software**: make sure to keep your database engine, drivers, operating system, and antivirus software up to date and patched. You can also use Firebird Guardian or InterBase Guardian to monitor and restart your database server in case of a crash.
- **Avoid direct access**: make sure to access your database files only through the database server and not directly from the file system. You can also use Firebird Lock Manager or InterBase Lock Manager to control concurrent access and avoid conflicts.

### How can I tell if my database is corrupted?
 
There are some signs that can indicate that your database is corrupted, such as:

- **Error messages**: such as "internal gds software consistency check" or "internal Firebird software consistency check" that appear when you try to open, backup, or restore your database.
- **Data anomalies**: such as missing, duplicated, or incorrect records that appear when you query your database.
- **Performance issues**: such as slow queries, high CPU usage, or memory leaks that occur when you work with your database.
- **File size changes**: such as sudden increase or decrease of your database file size that happen without any logical explanation.

If you notice any of these signs, you should stop using your database immediately and try to recover it with IBSurgeon FirstAID 3.5.
